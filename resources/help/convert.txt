Usage:
    xenodon convert [options] <source tiff path> <destination svo path>

Utility function to convert a 3D stacked TIFF image at <source tiff path>
into a sparse voxel octree at <destination svo path> which is accepted
by Xenodon.

Options:
--dag
    Compact this tree into a directed acyclic graph by eliminating equivalent
    subtrees. The basis of this method is described in 'High Resolution Sparse
    Voxel DAGs' by Kampe, Sintorn and Assarsson.

--rope
    Create a rope tree. Each leaf gets a point to its neighboring nodes, which
    increases traversal speed. The basis of this method is described in 'Ray
    Tracing with Rope Trees' by Havran, Bittner and Zara. These trees are
    compatible with other types of sparse voxel octreetraversal algorithms.

--chan-diff <value>
    Prune the generated tree with a 'channel difference' heuristic: Each node
    of which the corresponding voxels in each color channel differ by less
    than <value> will be pruned. Values range from 0-255. Note that
    --chan-diff 0 will create a lossless tree.

--std-dev <value>
    Prune the generated tree with a 'standard deviation' heuristic: Each node
    of which the standard deviation of the corresponding voxel colors is less
    than <value> will be pruned. The standard deviation is calculated over the
    euclidean distance of the voxel color channel values to the average.
    Values range from 0-255. Note that --std-dev 0 will create a lossless
    tree, though --chan-diff 0 is usually faster for that.
