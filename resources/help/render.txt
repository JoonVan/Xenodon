Usage:
    xenodon render [options] <volume path>

Render the volumetric model at <volume path>. One of the rendering backends
--xorg, --direct or --headless is required, see below for details.

Options:
-q --quiet
    Dont output logging information to standard out.

--log-output <file>
    Output logging information to <file>.

--repeat <amount>
    Render each frame <amount> times. Default is 1.

--volume-type <type>
    Override the type of the rendered volume, which by default is guessed
    from the file extension of the volume path. Accepted values are 'tiff',
    'tif', and 'svo'.

--camera <camera>
    Render from viewpoints provided by <camera>. Possible alternatives
    include:
    --camera orbit
        Render with an interactive orbit camera, which responds to keyboard
        input. This option is the default. Controls are
        - w/s to change pitch
        - a/d to change yaw
        - q/e to change roll
        - up/down to change zoom

    --camera <file>
        Read camera transformations from <file>. Each line of this file
        denotes a camera transformation, and has the following form:
        <forward x> <forward y> <forward z> <up x> <up y> <up z> <position x>
        <position y> <position z>
        The forward vector denotes the camera viewing direction, the up vector
        denotes the cameras up direction. The volume is always rendered at
        position (0, 0, 0) and stretches to (voxel ratio). Note that the viewing
        direction and the up vector must be perpendicular.

-e --emission-coeff
    Set the emission coefficient. Pixel colors are multiplied by this value.
    The default is 1.

-s --shader
    Set the ray traversal algorithm. Possible values include:
    dda
        The dda traversal algorithm, a modified version of 'A Fast Voxel
        Traversal Algorithm' by Amanatides and Woo. This algorithm can only be
        used for TIFF files, and is the default for volumes with a .tif or
        .tiff extension.

    svo-naive
        A naive traversal algorithm, which traverses the tree each iteration.
        This algorithm only traverses sparse voxel octrees, and is the default
        for volumes ending with a '.svo' extension.

    svo-df
        A depth-first traversal algorithm. This algorithm only traverses
        sparse voxel octrees.

    esvo
        A traversal algorithm adapted from 'Efficient Sparse Voxel Octrees' by
        Laine and Kerras. This algorithm only traverses sparse voxel octrees.

    svo-rope
        A traversal algorithm based on sparse voxel rope octrees, as generated
        by the --rope option (see 'xenodon help convert'). This algorithm only
        traverses sparse voxel octrees.

-r --voxel-ratio <ratio x>:<ratio y>:<ratio z>
    Set the scale size of the volume. Default is (1, 1, 1).

--stats-output <file>
    Save gathered statistics to <file>.

Render output backends:
--xorg
    Select the xorg rendering backend. This opens an xorg window to which
    rendering output will be displayed.

    Additional options:
    --xorg-multi-gpu <config>
        Use the xorg backend with multiple GPUs. This opens a set of
        fullscreen windows on the screens connected to each GPU. please refer
        to 'xenodon help xorg-multi-gpu' for further details on the format of
        <config>.

--headless <config>
    Select the headless rendering backend. This allows the program to render
    on a system with or without any monitor output attached, and saves
    the output of each frame in a PNG-image on disk instead. No interaction
    events are emitted by this backend. Please refer to 'xenodon help
    headless-config' for further details on the format of <config>.

    Additional options:
    --discard-output
        Don't save the output to disk. This option is particularly useful
        when benchmarking.

    --output <format>
        Override the rendering output path format. This format is a fmt format
        string, see https://fmt.dev/latest/syntax.html for details. The frame
        number is given in the first argument. The default is 'out-{}.png',
        for rendering images intended to be transformed into a video (for
        example with ffmpeg), 'out-{:0>3}.png' is a useful value.

--direct <config>
    Select the direct rendering backend. This allows the program to render
    directly to attached monitors, and requires there to be no display server
    outputting to the monitors. This can be achieved on GNU/Linux by switching
    to a different TTy, for example with ctrl+alt+F2. Xenodon can also be
    launched on a system running this way via a remote shell such as SSH.
    Please refer to 'xenodon help direct-config' for more information on the
    format of <config>.
