Usage:
    xenodon sysinfo

Display information about the host system which is relevant to operating
Xenodon. This includes listing GPUs detected, and listing their connected
displays. Output has the following format:

GPU <gpu-index>:
    name: <gpu-name>
    type: <type>
    Display <gpu-index>:
        name <display-name>
        resolution: <width>x<height>

GPU and Display entries can repeat. <gpu-index> and <display-index> can be
used in configuration files as identifiers for these particular devices.

Note that a Display in this context refers to a Vulkan VkDisplay object. A
list of these objects is obtained through the host operating system, and
on GNU/Linux this will not report anything if a display server such as X.org
is running. This is perfectly normal, as these modes are intended for the
direct rendering backend, which is intended for usage on systems without
a display server running.

If this utility function fails, it likely means Vulkan is not properly
set up on your system.
