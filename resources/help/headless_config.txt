The headless backend configuration file has the following format:

device {
    vkindex = <gpu-index>
    offset = (<offset x>, <offset-y>)
    extent = (<surface width>, <surface height>)
}

Any number of device statements are allowed. <offset x> and <offset y> are
offsets of the surfaces represented by their outputs, in pixels.
<surace width> and <surface height> are the dimensions of the surface rendered
by this GPU, in pixels. <gpu-index> is the index of the GPU as reported by
'xenodon sysinfo'.
