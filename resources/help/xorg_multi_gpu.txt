The xorg multi-gpu configuration file requires the following format:

output {
    displayname = "<xorg display>"
    offset = (<offset x>, <offset y>)
}

This configuration file format can take any number of 'output' statements.
<xorg display> is an X.org display identifier, which usually takes the form
of 'hostname:display.screen'. The hostname can be discarded when it is the
local computer. Display and screen take a numerical index of the display and
screen. The primary screen can for example be :0.0. Note that when using
multiple monitors on a single GPU, connected monitors are typically
grouped into a virtual screen. <offset x> and <offset y> are offsets of the
surfaces represented by their outputs, in pixels.
