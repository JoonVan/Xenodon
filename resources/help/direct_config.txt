The direct backend configuration file has the following format:

device {
    vkindex = <gpu-index>
    output {
        vkindex = <output-index>
        offset = (<offset-x>, <offset-y>)
    }
}

input {
    keyboard = "<keyboard event path>"
}

Any number of 'device' and 'output' statements are allowed, however each output
should be unique. <gpu-index> is the index of the gpu and <output-index> the
index of the display, as reported by 'xenodon sysinfo'. <offset x> and
<offset y> are offsets of the surfaces represented by their outputs, in pixels.

<keyboard event path> specifies the path to the Linux evdev input file for the
keyboard to be used for input events. The easiest way to find this is by
iterating the files found in /dev/input/by-id, and checking wether its the
right input file by checking if 'cat /dev/input/by-id/file' prints stuff when
one types on the desired keyboard. Note that all input events of this keyboard
are totally grabbed by the program until it terminates.
