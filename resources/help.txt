    sysinfo     Detect system information such as connected monitors and video
                cards.
    direct      Run the program in direct-mode. This requires there to be no
                x-server running and is able to run on a multi-gpu setup.
    xorg        Run the program in xorg-mode. This makes the program behave
                as if it were a normal program, but it is not able to use
                multiple video cards.
