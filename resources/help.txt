sysinfo
    Detect system information such as connected monitors and video cards.

render [flags] <mode> [mode flags]
    Run the program in render mode. <mode> is one of the available presenting
    modes, see below.

    Flags:
    -q --quiet
        Dont output logs to console.

    --log <file>
        Output logs to <file>.

    Presenting modes:
    direct <config>
        Direct presenting mode. This requires there to be no x-server
        running and is able to run on a multi-gpu setup. <config> is a path to
        a configuration file specifying the system setup. Entries in this file
        have the following format:

        device {{
            vkindex = <number>
            screen {{
                vkindex = <number>
                offset = (<offset x>, <offset y>)
            }}
        }}

        input {{
            keyboard = "/dev/input/path/to/keyboard"
            mouse = "/dev/input/mouse0"
        }}

        The config file must have at least one device entry, and each device
        entry must have at least one screen entry. The indices of the devices
        and the screens are the vulkan indices and must be unique. They can be 
        queried with the sysinfo subcommand. <offset>s are relative to (0, 0)
        and must be positive, with the origin at the top-left. The input paths
        are paths to the linux event files of the keyboard and mouse.

    xorg
        X11 presenting mode. This makes the program behave as if it were
        a normal program, but it is not able to use multiple video cards.

    headless <config>
        Render an image without a monitor, and save it to a .png file.
        <config> is a path of a config file, which has entries in the
        following format:

        device {{
            vkindex = <number>
            offset = (<offset x>, <offset y>)
            extent = (<width>, <height>)
        }}

        There must be at least one device entry, but vkindex does not have
        to be unique. The resulting image will have the size of the smallest
        enclosing rectangle around the images of each device.

        Additional flags:
        -o --output <output image>
            Override the output image location. The default is 'out.png'.
