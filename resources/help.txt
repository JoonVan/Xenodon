sysinfo
    Detect system information such as connected monitors and video cards.

direct <config file>
    Run the program in direct-mode. This requires there to be no x-server
    running and is able to run on a multi-gpu setup.
    <config file> is a path to a configuration file specifying the
    system setup. Entries in this file have the following format:
    
    device <index> {
        screen <index> at (<offset x>, <offset y>),
        screen <index> at (<offset x>, <offset y>)
    }

    The config file must have at least one device entry, and each device
    entry must have at least one screen entry. The indices of the devices
    and the screens are the vulkan indices and can be queried with the
    sysinfo subcommand. <offset>s are relative to (0, 0) and must be positive,
    with the origin at the top-left.

xorg
    Run the program in xorg-mode. This makes the program behave as if it were
    a normal program, but it is not able to use multiple video cards.
