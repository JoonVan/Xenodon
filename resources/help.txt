sysinfo
    Detect system information such as connected monitors and video cards.

render [flags] <mode> [mode parameters]
    Run the program in render mode. <mode> is one of the available presenting
    modes, see below.

    Flags:
    -q --quiet
        Dont output logs to console

    --log <file>
        Output logs to <file>

    Presenting modes:
    direct <config>
        Direct presenting mode. This requires there to be no x-server
        running and is able to run on a multi-gpu setup. <config> is a path to
        a configuration file specifying the system setup. Entries in this file
        have the following format:

        device {{
            vkindex = <number>
            screen {{
                vkindex = <number>
                offset = (<offset x>, <offset y>)
            }}
        }}

        input {{
            keyboard = "/dev/input/path/to/keyboard"
            mouse = "/dev/input/mouse0"
        }}

        The config file must have at least one device entry, and each device
        entry must have at least one screen entry. The indices of the devices
        and the screens are the vulkan indices and must be unique. They can be 
        ueried with the sysinfo subcommand. <offset>s are relative to (0, 0)
        and must be positive, with the origin at the top-left. The input paths
        are paths to the linux event files of the keyboard and mouse.

    xorg
        X11 presenting mode. This makes the program behave as if it were
        a normal program, but it is not able to use multiple video cards.
